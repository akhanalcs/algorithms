## Logarithms
What power do you have to raise the base to, to get another number.

For eg: $log{_2}{16}$ means 
- "How many 2s do you multiply together to get 16?" or
- "What power do you have to raise `2` to, to get `16`?"

``` math
\begin{align} log{_2}16&=x \\ 2^x& = 16 \\ x& = 4\end{align}
```

## Big O Notation
Big O notation tells you the number of operations an algorithm will make.

For eg: In case of Binary search, the running time of the algorithm in Big O notation is $O(\log n)$.

- Algorithm speed isn't measured in seconds, but in growth of the number of seconds.
- Instead, we talk about how quickly the runtime of an algorithm increases as the size of the input increases.
- Run time of algorithms is expressed in Big $O$ notation.
- $O(\log n)$ is faster than $O(n)$, but it gets a lot faster as the list of items you‚Äôre searching grows.

## Binary Search Algorithm
Binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. 

Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.

Binary search runs in logarithmic time in the worst case, making $O(\log n)$ comparisons, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array.

## Common Big O run times
- $O(\log n)$, also known as _log time_. Example: Binary search.
- $O(n)$, also known as _linear time_. Example: Simple search.
- $O(n * \log n)$. Example: A fast sorting algorithm, like quicksort.
- $O(n^2)$. Example: A slow sorting algorithm, like selection sort. Try to remember it like `ss` so `nn` -> $n^2$.
- $O(n!)$. Example: A really slow algorithm, like the traveling salesperson. For eg: To go through 5 cities, you have to calculate $5!$ which is $120$. It grows really, really fast. ü§Ø

## Arrays and Linked Lists
### Arrays
Sometimes you need to store a list of elements in memory. Suppose you‚Äôre writing an app to manage your todos. You‚Äôll want to store the todos as a list in memory.
For eg, the todo list is:
- Brunch
- Bocce
- Tea

Storing the todos in array looks like

<img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/akhanalcs/algorithms/assets/30603497/a5160383-67db-43eb-8abf-ae7ed0b524c8">

Now suppose you want to add a fourth task. But the next memory location is taken up by someone else‚Äôs stuff.

If you‚Äôre out of space and need to move to a new spot in memory every time, adding a new item will be really slow.

### Linked Lists
With linked lists, your items can be anywhere in memory.
Each item stores the address of the next item in the list. A bunch of random memory addresses are linked together.

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/akhanalcs/algorithms/assets/30603497/36a034ae-33a6-4c8d-bc50-7e7bc1d2c109">

You go to the first address, and it says, ‚ÄúThe next item can be found at address 123.‚Äù So you go to address 123, and it says, ‚ÄúThe next item can be found at address 847,‚Äù and so on. Adding an item to a linked list is easy: you stick it anywhere in memory and store the 
address with the previous item.

With linked lists, you never have to move your items. 

### Insertions and deletions work great in Lists
Lets say you want to add items in a certain order.

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/akhanalcs/algorithms/assets/30603497/a59e4c61-2ab3-4de2-9b7b-ea23e83887f0">

With lists, it‚Äôs as easy as changing what the previous element points to.

<img width="650" alt="image" src="https://github.com/akhanalcs/algorithms/assets/30603497/42cfd79f-0ff6-46b8-a91c-efe3772a488d">

But for arrays, you have to shift all the rest of the elements down.

<img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/akhanalcs/algorithms/assets/30603497/57c70d22-2937-4fea-ad69-13e5e9e9385c">

And if there‚Äôs no space, you might have to copy everything to a new location! Lists are better if you want to insert elements into the middle. 

### Runtimes for common operations on Arrays and Lists
|  | Arrays | Lists |
|---|---|---|
| Reading | $O(1)$ | $O(n)$ |
| Insertion | $O(n)$ | $O(1)$ |
| Deletion | $O(n)$ | $O(1)$ |

It‚Äôs worth mentioning that insertions and deletions are $O(1)$ time only if you can instantly access the element to be deleted. It‚Äôs a common practice to keep track of the first and last items in a linked list, so it would take only $O(1)$ time to delete those.

### List<T> vs LinkedList<T> in C#

  </tr>

<tbody>
  <tr>
  <td valign="top">
  <p><code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> is essentially just an array (with a wrapper), so random access is efficient.</p>
  </td>
  <td valign="top">
  <p><code>LinkedList&lt;T&gt;</code> is composed of nodes with each node consisting its value and pointers/reference to the next and previous node.</p>
  <p>Elements' access is only efficient if it's done consecutively (either forwards or backwards).</p>
  <p>Random access is relatively expensive since it must walk the chain each time (hence why it doesn't have an indexer).</p>

  <p>In most cases, <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> is more useful.</p>
  <p><code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> can only cheaply add/remove at the end of the list because it doesn't require shifting of elements.</p>

  <p>Adding or removing elements from a <code>LinkedList&lt;T&gt;</code> can be done quickly at any position given you have a reference to a node close to the operation's location.</p>
  <p><code>LinkedList&lt;T&gt;</code> will have less cost when adding/removing items in the middle of the list.</p>
  For example:
  
  ```csharp
  LinkedList<int> myList = new LinkedList<int>();
  myList.AddLast(1);
  // We keep a reference to this node
  LinkedListNode<int> myNode = myList.AddLast(2);
  myList.AddLast(3);
  ```

  <p>We can insert a new element after the element 2. Since you already have a reference to this Node, you can simply use the <code>.AddAfter</code> method:</p>
  
  ```csharp
  // This will insert 4 after 2
  myList.AddAfter(myNode, 4);

## Selection Sort Algorithm
Suppose you have a bunch of music on your computer. For each artist, you have a play count.
You want to sort this list from most to least played, so that you can rank your favorite artists. 

One way is to go through the list and find the most-played artist. Add that artist to a new list.

<img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/akhanalcs/algorithms/assets/30603497/82531c93-b3ff-4741-b68d-f9150cada251">

Do it again to find the next-most-played artist.

<img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/akhanalcs/algorithms/assets/30603497/c06c9604-8199-44fc-ae2b-de524766da8a">

Keep doing this, and you‚Äôll end up with a sorted list.

Now let's find how long it takes to run. **Remember that $O(n)$ time means you touch every element in a list once**.

You have an operation that takes $O(n)$ time, and you have to do that $n$ times:

<img width="750" alt="image" src="https://github.com/akhanalcs/algorithms/assets/30603497/a42b74a6-7d4f-4959-b447-e86d40daa3ad">

This takes $O(n √ó n)$ time or $O(n^2)$ time.

Code example:
https://github.com/akhanalcs/algorithms/blob/f8338488287750ec939c2171a389424f354d043b/src/Algorithms/Sort/SelectionSorter.cs#L5-L31

## Recursion
Suppose you‚Äôre digging through your grandma‚Äôs attic and come across a mysterious locked suitcase.

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/akhanalcs/algorithms/assets/30603497/750d88ca-cd4a-4aa7-9c40-6f18e98351c7">

Grandma tells you that the key for the suitcase is probably in this other box.

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/akhanalcs/algorithms/assets/30603497/1b577ed5-78ad-44b0-a0a3-9586c02ad19c">

Here's a way to find the key using recursion
```py
# Every recursive function has two parts: the base case, and the recursive case
def look_for_key(box):
  for item in box:
    # Recursive case: when the function calls itself.
    if item.is_a_box():
      look_for_key(item) # <--- Recursion!
    # Base case: when the function doesn't call itself again
    elif item.is_a_key():
      print ‚Äúfound the key!‚Äù
```
