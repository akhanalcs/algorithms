## Logarithms
What power do you have to raise the base to, to get another number.

For eg: $log{_2}{16}$ means 
- "How many 2s do you multiply together to get 16?" or
- "What power do you have to raise `2` to, to get `16`?"

``` math
\begin{align} log{_2}16&=x \\ 2^x& = 16 \\ x& = 4\end{align}
```

## Big O Notation
Big O notation tells you the number of operations an algorithm will make.

For eg: In case of Binary search, the running time of the algorithm in Big O notation is $O(\log n)$.

- Algorithm speed isn't measured in seconds, but in growth of the number of seconds.
- Instead, we talk about how quickly the runtime of an algorithm increases as the size of the input increases.
- Run time of algorithms is expressed in Big $O$ notation.
- $O(\log n)$ is faster than $O(n)$, but it gets a lot faster as the list of items youâ€™re searching grows.

## Binary Search Algorithm
Binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. 

Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.

Binary search runs in logarithmic time in the worst case, making $O(\log n)$ comparisons, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array.

## Common Big O run times
- $O(\log n)$, also known as _log time_. Example: Binary search.
- $O(n)$, also known as _linear time_. Example: Simple search.
- $O(n * \log n)$. Example: A fast sorting algorithm, like quicksort.
- $O(n^2)$. Example: A slow sorting algorithm, like selection sort.
- $O(n!)$. Example: A really slow algorithm, like the traveling salesperson.
