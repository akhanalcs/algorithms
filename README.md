## Logarithms
What power do you have to raise the base to, to get another number.

For eg: $log{_2}{16}$ means 
- "How many 2s do you multiply together to get 16?" or
- "What power do you have to raise `2` to, to get `16`?"

``` math
\begin{align} log{_2}16&=x \\ 2^x& = 16 \\ x& = 4\end{align}
```

## Big O Notation
Big O notation tells you the number of operations an algorithm will make.

For eg: In case of Binary search, the running time of the algorithm in Big O notation is `O(log n)`.
